description=Allows digging through walls to expand basements. To dig, you need a shovel and some sacks to carry the dug out dirt in. Digging will tire you out very quickly.

description=[h1]Future features[/h1]
description=While it is to the best of my knowledge stable, this mod is still WIP. Intended future features are:
description=[list]
description=[*]Digging downwards to create entirely new underground areas and sub-basements. This is my highest priority.
description=[*]Building stairs upwards out of underground areas.
description=[*]Require sledgehammering walls before digging through them.
description=[*]Stability system that requires you to build sufficient supports or risk a lethal cave-in.
description=[*]'Minecraft' mode with underground ores.
description=[*]Allow building new walls directly on top of dirt walls.

description=[h1]Known issues[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*]Excavated areas are not considered indoors, so you will be rained on. This seems to be a hard limitation of the game, but I am still researching ways to bypass this.
description=[*]Sledgehammers behave very weirdly in basements. [b]This is a vanilla issue.[/b]
